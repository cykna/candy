This is supposed to be the "continuation" of Hyst.
I made everything wrong on hyst(even tho things were working), whatever, imma write it with skia.
This is an attempt to build a 2D/3D library with support to multiple renderers.
The support is made via traits, so anything that implements the renderer traits of this library is able to run.

# Todo
  * Implement Renderers for skia using Vulkan, Metal and DirectX
  * Start Working with 3D
  * Add Animations
  * Add support for Vello as a builtin renderer instead of Skia
  * Add support for tiny-skia

# Completed
  * Add effects
  * Add basic components
